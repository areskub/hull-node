# Connector toolkit
This library includes a base toolkit to create a ship - connector to integrate Hull platform with a selected 3rd party API Service.

## Application

### HullApp
```js
import Hull from "hull";

const app = new Hull.App({ port, hostSecret, service });

// ... application configuration

app.start();

```

#### server
```js
const app = new Hull.App({ port, hostSecret, service });

const server = app.server();

server.use("/customRoute", customRouter);
```

This is a base public facing web application which exposes a http rest api to communicate with hull platform.
The `app.server()` method returns an instance of [express](http://expressjs.com/) application with basic static router which serves [manifest.json](https://www.hull.io/docs/apps/ships/#file-structure) file and README.md.

#### worker
```js
const app = new Hull.App({ port, hostSecret, service });

// Worker needs Queue instance - details below
const worker = app.worker();

worker.attach({
  customJob: (req) => { process }
});
```

More complex ships needs to handle its operation using a background queue. This toolkit provides a base worker application which consume the jobs queued from both `server` and `worker`.

## Context Object
In all `server` actions and `worker` there is a context object available as a first argument of the callbacks.
Here are the details about the api: [Context](./CONTEXT.md)

## Utils
In addition to the Applications the toolkit provides a variety of the utilities to perform most common actions of the ship. Following list of handlers includes a prebuild Express routers which performs most common operations of connectors. 

### actionHandler() `incoming`
This is the simplest requests handler to expose custom logic through custom API POST endpoint. The possible usage is triggering a custom operation (like fetching historical data) or a webhook. Both cases handle data `incoming` into Hull platform. However in case of busy webhook it's better to use `batcherHandler` which automatically group the incoming requests into batches.

```js
const app = new Hull.App({}).server();
import { actionHandler } from "hull/lib/utils";

app.use("/fetch-all", actionHandler((ctx, { query, body }) => {
  const { hull, ship } = ctx;

  const { api_token } = ship.private_settings;
  const serviceClient = new ServiceClient(api_token);
  return serviceClient.getHistoricalData()
    .then(users => {
      users.map(u => {
        hull.as({ email: u.email }).traits({
          new_trait: u.custom_value
        });
      });
    });
}));
```

### batcherHandler() `incoming`
The second `incoming` handler which works in a simillar way as `actionHandler` but it also groups incoming requests into batches of selected size:

```js
const app = new Hull.App({}).server();
import { batcherHandler } from "hull/lib/utils";

app.use("/fetch-all", batcherHandler((ctx, requests) => {
  requests.map(request => {
    console.log(request); // { query, body }
  })
}, {
  maxSize: 100, // maximum size of the batch
  maxTime: 1000 // time time in milliseconds to flush batch after the first item came in
}));
```

### notifHandler() `outgoing`

NotifHandler is a packaged solution to receive User and Segment Notifications from Hull. It's built to be used as an express route. Hull will receive notifications if your ship's `manifest.json` exposes a `subscriptions` key:

```json
{
  "subscriptions" : [ { "url" : "/notify" } ]
}
```

Here's how to use it.

```js
const app = new Hull.App({}).server();
import { notifHandler } from "hull/lib/utils";

const handler = NotifHandler({
  userHandlerOptions: {
    groupTraits: true, // groups traits as in below examples
    maxSize: 6,
    maxTime: 10000
  },
  onSubscribe() {} // called when a new subscription is installed
  handlers: {
    "ship:update": function(ctx, messages = []) {},
    "segment:update": function(ctx, messages = []) {},
    "segment:delete": function(ctx, messages = []) {},
    "user:update" : function(ctx, messages = []) {
      console.log('Event Handler here', ctx, messages);
      // ctx: Context Object, see docs above
      // messages: [{
      //   user: { id: '123', ... },
      //   segments: [{}],
      //   changes: {},
      //   events: [{}, {}]
      // }]
    }
  }
})

app.use('/notify', handler);
```

Your app can subscribe to events from Hull and receive Events via http POST.
For this we provide a helper called NotifHandler that handles all the complexity of subscribing to events and routing them to specific methods. All you need to do is declare which methods handle what Events.

### batchHandler() `outgoing`

BatchHandler is a packaged solution to receive Batches of Users. It's built to be used as an express route. Hull will receive notifications if your ship's `manifest.json` exposes a `batch` tag in `tags`:

```json
{
  "tags" : [ "batch" ]
}
```

Here is how to use it:

```js
const app = new Hull.App({}).server();
import { batchHandler } from "hull/lib/utils";

const handler = BatchHandler(function(context = {}, users = []) {
  // Context is the main Context object
  // user object (see notifHandler docs)
  users.map(u => updateUser(context, u));
}, {
  groupTraits: false,
  batchSize: 100 // the maximum size of users array
});

app.use('/batch', handler);
```

### oAuthHandler()

OAuthHandler is a packaged authentication handler using [Passport](http://passportjs.org/). You give it the right parameters, it handles the entire auth scenario for you.

It exposes hooks to check if the ship is Set up correctly, inject additional parameters during login, and save the returned settings during callback.

Here is how to use it:

```js
import Hull from "hull";
import { oAuthHandler } from "hull/src/utils";
import { Strategy as HubspotStrategy } from "passport-hubspot";

const app = new Hull.App({}).server();

app.use("/auth", OAuthHandler({
  name: "Hubspot",
  tokenInUrl: true,
  Strategy: HubspotStrategy,
  options: {
    clientID: "xxxxxxxxx",
    clientSecret: "xxxxxxxxx", //Client Secret
    scope: ["offline", "contacts-rw", "events-rw"] //App Scope
  },
  isSetup(req) {
    if (!!req.query.reset) return Promise.reject();
    const { token } = req.hull.ship.private_settings || {};
    return (!!token) ? Promise.resolve({ valid: true, total: 2}) : Promise.reject({ valid: false, total: 0});
  },
  onLogin: (req) => {
    req.authParams = { ...req.body, ...req.query };
    return req.hull.client.updateSettings({
      portalId: req.authParams.portalId
    });
  },
  onAuthorize: (req) => {
    const { refreshToken, accessToken } = (req.account || {});
    return req.hull.client.updateSettings({
      refresh_token: refreshToken,
      token: accessToken
    });
  },
  views: {
    login: "login.html",
    home: "home.html",
    failure: "failure.html",
    success: "success.html"
  },
}));
```


#### manifest.json
```json
{
  "admin" : "/auth/",
}
```
#### Params:

##### name
The name displayed to the User in the various screens.

##### tokenInUrl

Some services (like Stripe) require an exact URL match.
Some others (like Hubspot) don't pass the state back on the other hand.

Setting this flag to false (default: true) removes the `token` Querystring parameter in the URL to only rely on the `state` param. 

##### Strategy
A Passport Strategy.

##### options
An options hash passed to Passport to configure the OAuth Strategy. (See [Passport OAuth Configuration](http://passportjs.org/docs/oauth))

##### isSetup()
A method returning a Promise, resolved if the ship is correctly setup, or rejected if it needs to display the Login screen.

Lets you define in the Ship the name of the parameters you need to check for.

You can return parameters in the Promise resolve and reject methods, that will be passed to the view. This lets you display status and show buttons and more to the customer

##### onLogin()
A method returning a Promise, resolved when ready.

Best used to process form parameters, and place them in `req.authParams` to be submitted to the Login sequence. Useful to add strategy-specific parameters, such as a portal ID for Hubspot for instance.

##### onAuthorize()

A method returning a Promise, resolved when complete.
Best used to save tokens and continue the sequence once saved.

##### views

Required, A hash of view files for the different screens.
Each view will receive the following data:

```js
views: {
  login: "login.html",
  home: "home.html",
  failure: "failure.html",
  success: "success.html"
}
//each view will receive the following data:
{
  name: "The name passed as handler",
  urls: {
    login: '/auth/login',
    success: '/auth/success',
    failure: '/auth/failure',
    home: '/auth/home',
  },
  ship: ship //The entire Ship instance's config
}
```


## Process level modules - infrastrcture

To run properly the applications needs some infrascture modules which needs to be initiated at the process level and then passed to the applications as dependencies. This is an optional step and it's needed in case of more detailed control of the configuration.

### Queue
It adds `req.hull.queue` function which takes name of the job, the payload as arguments. By default it's initiated inside `Hull.App` as a very simplistic in-memory queue, but in case of production grade needs, it comes with a [Kue](https://github.com/Automattic/kue) adapter which can be created like that.
When you pass your custom `queue` instance, the `Hull.App` will use it instead of the default one.

```js
import { Queue } from "hull/lib/ship/infra";

const queue = new Queue("kue", { options });

const app = new Hull.App({ queue });
```

### Cache
It adds `req.hull.cache` to store the ship and segments information in the cache not to
fetch it for every request. The `req.hull.cache` is automatically picked and used by the `Hull.Middleware`
and `segmentsMiddleware`. The default comes with the basic in-memory store, but in case of distributed connectors being run in multiple processes for reliable operation a shared cache solution should be used.
The Cache module internally uses [node-cache-manager](https://github.com/BryanDonovan/node-cache-manager), so any of it's compatibile store like `redis` or `memcache` could be used:

```js
import { Cache } from "hull/lib/ship/infra";

const cache = new Cache({ options });

const app = new Hull.App({ cache });
```

### Instrumentation
It automatically sends data to DataDog, Sentry and Newrelic if appropriate ENV VARS are set.
It also adds `req.hull.metric` agent to add custom metrics to the ship. Right now it doesn't take any custom options, but it's showed here for the sake of completeness.

```js
import { Instrumentation } from "hull/lib/ship/infra";

const instrumentation = new Instrumentation();

const app = new Hull.App({ instrumentation });
```

### Batcher


## Internal libraries
This is a set of internal utilities being used by the `Hull.App` and `Handlers`.
They should be used in case of special requirements or a need of greater customization.


### serviceMiddleware
This is a middleware which helps to inject the custom ship modules to the request object.
Thanks to that, all the custom functions and classes are automatically bind to the context object:

```js
import { serviceMiddleware } from "hull/lib/ship/util";

const app = express();

app.use(Hull.Middleware({ hostSecret }));
app.use(serviceMiddleware({
  getSegmentIds: (ctx, customParams = {}) => {
    ctx.client.get("/segments", customParams)
      .then(segments => {
        return segments.map(s => s.id);
      });
  },
  customClass: class CustomClass {
    constructor(ctx) {
      this.ctx = ctx;
    }
  }
}))

app.post("/get-segments", (req, res) => {
  const { service } = req.hull;

  service.getSegmentIds({ limit: 500 })
    .then((segments) => res.json(segments), () => res.end)
})
```

### exitHandler
This is a module to simplify grace shutdown of the application. Two infrastrcture services needs to be notified about the exit event:

- `Queue` - to drain and stop the current queue processing
- `Batcher` which needs to flush all pending data.
